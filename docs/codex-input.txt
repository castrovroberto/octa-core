Here’s a high-level, prioritized backlog to get from today’s skeletal “OctaCell” prototype all the way to a playable, polished directional-contagion game.  I’ve grouped tasks by
 broad category, but you can tackle them in roughly the order shown.

    1. Core Grid & Cell Model
       • Design a small abstraction for “GridType” (HEX, SQUARE, OCTAGON) and a unified Coordinate/Cell API.
       • Replace the toy ring-only octagon generator with a correct octagonal (and hexagonal) grid generator (i.e. 8n cells in ring n for oct, proper axial coords for hex).
       • Implement `calculateRelativeDirection` (and per-shape neighbor linking) so each cell’s `getNeighbor(dir)` works.
    2. Foundation Tests
       • Write unit tests for grid-generation and neighbor-linking on each shape (small n, edge cells, center).
       • Verify that for a 2-ring octagon you actually get 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 cells with correct adjacencies.
    3. Core Game Rules (`GameLogic`)
       • Flesh out `isValidMove(cell)` (e.g. you can only rotate your own arrow or capture a neutral cell).
       • Implement `makeMove(cell)`:
         – Rotate/capture the selected cell.
         – Recursively follow its arrow, capturing & rotating until a stopping condition.
       • Encode stopping conditions (edge‐of‐grid, owned cell, loop, optional “stop on enemy”).
    4. GameLogic Tests
       • Unit-test single‐move chain reactions on minimal maps (e.g. 2×2 square, 2-ring octagon).
       • Test all stopping conditions and that ownership/states update correctly.
    5. Turn Management & Engine Integration
       • Extend `GameEngine` to:
         – Hold `GameLogic` and current player.
         – Loop turns: read a move, validate, apply logic, switch player.
       • Hook your `GameLogic` impl into `GameEngine.processTurn()`.
    6. CLI User Interface
       • Print the board each turn in ASCII (rings or matrix) with arrow-glyphs.
       • Accept console input to pick a cell (by ring+dir or row/col) and rotate it.
       • Validate input and surface errors back to the user.
    7. Win & Stop Conditions
       • Implement “all opponent cells eliminated” and “turn limit + majority” endgames.
       • Allow the user to pick the win mode at startup.
       • Display results and gracefully exit.
    8. Integration & Regression Tests
       • Write “play‐through” tests with scripted moves to exercise full games.
       • CI integration to catch regressions in grid, logic or engine.
    9. Game Modes & Configuration
       • Expose quick/classic/challenge modes (board size, turn limit, victory thresholds).
       • Allow configuration via command-line flags or a simple config file.
    10. Single-Player AI Opponent
           • Plug in a `Player` interface and a basic “random/greedy” CPU.
           • Later iterate on heuristics or a minimax solver for deeper play.
    11. Graphical UI / Visualization
           • Swap or augment the CLI with a minimal JavaFX/Swing (or web) front-end.
           • Draw octagons/hexes, arrow icons, and click/tap support.
    12. Networked Multiplayer & Persistence
           • Add a simple server/client layer so two humans can connect over TCP.
           • Implement save/load so players can pause/resume.
    13. Performance & Scalability
           • Profile large boards (e.g. 9-ring hex or 20×20 octagon).
           • Optimize the chain‐reaction recursion/loop detection and data structures.
    14. Documentation & Packaging
           • Update README with “Getting Started”, CLI flags, game-modes, config.
           • Publish a runnable JAR or native installer.
           • Write a short “Developer Guide” for how the grid and logic fit together.
