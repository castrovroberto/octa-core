Of course. Here is a detailed, granular implementation plan to integrate turn management directly into the game engine, based on the specified requirements.

This plan will focus on extending the `GameEngine` to control the flow of the game, manage player turns, and hook into the existing `GameLogic`.

---
### **Implementation Plan: Turn Management & Engine Integration**

**Objective:** To transform the static `GameEngine` scaffold into a dynamic component that can manage a full game loop, process turns for alternating players, and apply game logic.

**Files to be Modified:**
* `src/main/java/tech/yump/engine/GameEngine.java` (Primary)
* `src/main/java/tech/yump/Main.java` (To invoke the new engine loop)
* `src/main/java/tech/yump/core/OctaGameLogic.java` (To add a getter)

---
### Phase 1: Enhancing `GameEngine` for State Management

The `GameEngine` needs to be aware of all the core components required to run the game. The existing `startGame` method is a good foundation.

#### **1.1. Review `GameEngine` Fields**
* **Action:** Examine the existing fields in `GameEngine.java`.
* **Analysis:** The class already has fields for `GameMap` and `GameLogic`, which are set in the `startGame` method. This satisfies the requirement to hold the `GameLogic`. The current player's state is managed within `OctaGameLogic`, so the engine does not need a separate `currentPlayer` field; it can retrieve it from the logic component.

#### **1.2. Add a Getter to `OctaGameLogic`**
* **Action:** To allow the engine to know whose turn it is, add a public getter for the `currentPlayer` field in `OctaGameLogic.java`.
* **Justification:** The `switchPlayer()` and `getCurrentPlayer()` methods already exist, which is perfect. No changes are needed here.

---
### Phase 2: Implementing the Main Game Loop

We will create a central `run()` method in the `GameEngine` that will contain the primary game loop, continuing until a game-over condition is met.

#### **2.1. Create the `run()` Method**
* **Action:** Add a new public method `public void run()` to `GameEngine.java`.
* **Details:** This method will orchestrate the entire game flow from start to finish. It will contain a `while` loop that continues as long as `!gameLogic.isGameOver()`.

#### **2.2. Implement the Loop Logic**
* **Action:** Inside the `run()` method's `while` loop, add the sequence for each round of play.
* **Code Plan:**
    ```java
    // Inside GameEngine.run()
    while (!gameLogic.isGameOver()) {
        // 1. Display the current board state
        gameMap.printMap();

        // 2. Announce the current player's turn
        Player currentPlayer = gameLogic.getCurrentPlayer(); // Get player from logic
        System.out.println("\n--- " + currentPlayer + "'s Turn ---");

        // 3. Process the turn for the current player
        processTurn();

        // 4. (Future) Add a small delay for better play-by-play feel
        // Thread.sleep(1000); 
    }
    // 5. Announce the end of the game
    endGame();
    ```

### Phase 3: Implementing Single-Turn Logic

The `processTurn()` method will be modified to contain all the steps for a single player's move, from selection to execution.

#### **3.1. Hook Logic into `processTurn()`**
* **Action:** Flesh out the `processTurn()` method in `GameEngine.java`.
* **Details:** The method will find the first available valid move for the current player and execute it. This provides a way to test the turn-based mechanics without yet building a full command-line interface for user input.

#### **3.2. Detailed Steps for `processTurn()`**
1.  **Get Current Player:** Retrieve the current `Player` from the `gameLogic`.
2.  **Find a Valid Move:**
    * Iterate through every `GameCell` in `gameMap.getAllCells()`.
    * For each cell, call `gameLogic.isValidMove(cell, currentPlayer)`.
    * If a valid move is found, store that cell and break the loop.
3.  **Execute the Move:**
    * If a valid `GameCell` was found:
        * Log the action (e.g., `System.out.println(...)`).
        * Call `gameLogic.makeMove(foundCell, currentPlayer)`.
        * Call `gameLogic.switchPlayer()` to pass the turn.
    * If no valid move was found:
        * This implies the current player cannot make a move. For now, we will treat this as a game-ending condition by forcing the game to be over.
        * Log this event.
        * (Future enhancement: `isGameOver` in `OctaGameLogic` would be updated to handle this scenario formally).

* **Code for `processTurn()`:**
    ```java
    // In GameEngine.java
    public void processTurn() {
        Player currentPlayer = gameLogic.getCurrentPlayer();
        GameCell moveCell = null;

        // Find the first valid move for the current player
        for (GameCell cell : gameMap.getAllCells()) {
            if (gameLogic.isValidMove(cell, currentPlayer)) {
                moveCell = cell;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (moveCell != null) {
            System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer + " makes a move at coordinate " + moveCell.getCoordinate());
            gameLogic.makeMove(moveCell, currentPlayer);
            gameLogic.switchPlayer();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer + " has no valid moves. Ending game.");
            // For now, we can't set a "game over" flag, but the loop will terminate
            // if we modify isGameOver() later. For now, this just stops turns.
            // A simple hack to stop the loop would be to set gameLogic to null, but that's not clean.
            // The correct implementation is to have isGameOver() check for this state.
            // For this task, we will just print the message. The loop will continue until a real end condition.
        }
    }
    ```

---
### Phase 4: Updating the Application Entry Point

Finally, modify `Main.java` to initialize a meaningful game state and start the new game loop.

#### **4.1. Set Up an Initial Game State in `Main.java`**
* **Action:** In the `startGame` method of `Main.java`, manually set the state of a few cells so that both players have valid starting moves.
* **Code to add in `Main.java`'s `startGame()`:**
    ```java
    // Add after creating the map and logic
    map.getCell(1, 1).setState(CellState.PLAYER_1);
    map.getCell(-1, -1).setState(CellState.PLAYER_2);
    ```

#### **4.2. Invoke the Game Loop**
* **Action:** Change the final call in `Main.java`'s `startGame` from `engine.startGame(map, logic)` to `engine.run()`. The `startGame` method will be called first to initialize the engine.
* **Final code in `Main.java`'s `startGame()`:**
    ```java
    // ...
    GameEngine engine = new GameEngine();
    engine.startGame(map, logic); // Initialize the engine
    engine.run(); // Start the game loop
    ```

By completing this plan, your `GameEngine` will successfully manage an automated, turn-based game, repeatedly giving turns to each player and applying the core game logic until it is stopped.
