Of course. Let's devise a plan to implement a suite of integration tests that simulate full gameplay and set up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow to automate regression testing.

This plan is divided into two parts: first, writing the "play-through" tests, and second, configuring the CI pipeline.

---
### **Part 1: Implementing "Play-Through" Integration Tests**

This part focuses on creating a new test class that exercises the entire game flow from start to finish using a scripted sequence of moves.

#### **Phase 1: Making the `GameEngine` More Testable**

To feed scripted moves into the engine without requiring a real user, we first need to refactor `GameEngine` to remove its direct dependency on the `CLIView` for input.

##### **1.1. Create a `MoveProvider` Functional Interface**
* **Action:** Create a new functional interface that defines a contract for supplying moves. This decouples the engine from the source of the moves (be it a human user or a test script).
* **File to Create:** `src/main/java/tech/yump/engine/MoveProvider.java`
* **Contents:**
    ```java
    package tech.yump.engine;

    import tech.yump.util.Coordinate;

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface MoveProvider {
        /**
         * Provides the next move's coordinate.
         * @return The Coordinate for the next move.
         */
        Coordinate getNextMove();
    }
    ```

##### **1.2. Refactor `GameEngine` to Use the `MoveProvider`**
* **Action:** Modify `GameEngine.java` to use the `MoveProvider` instead of directly calling the `CLIView`.
* **Plan:**
    1.  Add a `private MoveProvider moveProvider;` field to `GameEngine`.
    2.  Update the `startGame` method signature to accept the `MoveProvider`:
        `public void startGame(GameMap map, GameLogic logic, CLIView view, MoveProvider provider)`
    3.  In `processTurn`, replace `Coordinate coord = view.promptForMove();` with `Coordinate coord = moveProvider.getNextMove();`.

##### **1.3. Update `Main.java` to Provide the Real Move Provider**
* **Action:** In `Main.java`, create the `MoveProvider` as a lambda function that calls the `CLIView`.
* **Code in `Main.java`'s `startGame()`:**
    ```java
    // ...
    CLIView view = new CLIView();
    // The MoveProvider for the real game gets moves from the CLIView
    MoveProvider humanPlayerProvider = () -> view.promptForMove();

    GameEngine engine = new GameEngine();
    engine.startGame(map, logic, view, humanPlayerProvider); // Pass the provider
    engine.run();
    ```

#### **Phase 2: Creating the Integration Test Class**

Now we can create the test class that provides a scripted sequence of moves.

##### **2.1. Create the Test File**
* **Action:** Create a new test file: `src/test/java/tech/yump/engine/GameEngineIntegrationTest.java`.

##### **2.2. Implement a Play-Through Test for Elimination**
* **Action:** Add a test method that simulates a short game where one player eliminates the other.
* **Test Plan (`playthrough_Player1WinsByElimination`)**
    1.  **Arrange:**
        * Create a small `GameMap` (e.g., size 1).
        * Create a `GameConfig` for the `ELIMINATION` win condition.
        * Set up the initial board state: `P1` at (0,0), `P2` at (1,0). Set `P1`'s arrow to point towards `P2`.
        * Create a scripted `MoveProvider`. This can be done using a `Queue` of coordinates.
            ```java
            // Inside the test method
            Queue<Coordinate> scriptedMoves = new LinkedList<>();
            scriptedMoves.add(new Coordinate(0, 0)); // P1's move
            MoveProvider testProvider = () -> scriptedMoves.poll();
            ```
    2.  **Act:**
        * Initialize and run the `GameEngine` with the test `MoveProvider`.
    3.  **Assert:**
        * After `engine.run()` completes, check that `gameLogic.isGameOver()` is `true`.
        * Get the `GameResult` and assert that the winner is `PLAYER_1` and the reason is "by elimination".
        * Verify that the final count of `PLAYER_2` cells on the map is 0.

### **Part 2: CI Integration with GitHub Actions**

This part details how to create a workflow that automatically builds and tests the project on every push and pull request.

#### **Phase 3: Creating the CI Workflow File**

##### **3.1. Create the Directory Structure**
* **Action:** At the root of your `octa-core` repository, create a directory named `.github`. Inside it, create another directory named `workflows`.
* **Final Path:** `.github/workflows/`

##### **3.2. Create the Workflow YAML File**
* **Action:** Inside the `.github/workflows/` directory, create a new file named `build-and-test.yml`.

#### **Phase 4: Defining the Workflow Job**

* **Action:** Add the following content to `build-and-test.yml`. This configuration defines a single job that builds and tests the code.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build-and-test.yml

name: Java CI Build and Test

# Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up JDK 21, as specified in pom.xml
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21' # From <maven.compiler.source> in pom.xml
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # Step 3: Build the project and run all tests with Maven
      # The 'test' goal automatically executes the surefire plugin, which runs JUnit tests.
      - name: Build and Test with Maven
        run: mvn -B clean test # '-B' runs Maven in non-interactive (batch) mode

```

**To activate this CI pipeline:**
1.  Commit the `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` file to your repository.
2.  Push the commit to your `main` branch on GitHub.
3.  Navigate to the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository page. You will see the workflow run automatically. It will run again on every subsequent push or pull request to the `main` branch, providing immediate feedback on whether your changes have broken any existing functionality.
